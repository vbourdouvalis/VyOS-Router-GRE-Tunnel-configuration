# Scripts for GRE tunnel between Linux Client and VyOS Router

The repository regards two simple bash scripts for creating a secure Tunnel between a Linux Client and a VyOS router using the GRE Protocol.

By changing the client IP(147.102.7.79) and the router IP(147.102.30.69) as well as the tunnel endpoint IPS and running the scripts as a superuser it could be used for a simple and fast congifuration between the two endpoints.

It is very helpful in cases many clients need to connect directly on a VyOS router.
